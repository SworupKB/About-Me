- Hello amazing developers 👋 !! Welcome to my GitHub account. I graduated majoring in International Business Management, so coding is definintely not my area of expertise 😖
- I am interested in **Product Management** 📚 and having some idea about the technical aspects of any product is pretty important ❗❗ alongside a numerous other things
- Currently, I am building 🛠 my own website using a website builder. While it is so much easier, I do occasionally HAVE to code for achieving specific functions. Github has helped a lot and hence, here I am 😤
And surprisingly, coding is kinda growing on me...
- I’m looking forward to collaborate 💞️ on any Product development projects, learn more about coding and how it all works. That includes both frontend and backend   
- 📫 You can find me on LinkedIn under the name: Sworup Kumar Behuria 
Just shoot me a message, connect and let's grow TOGETHER!!!
